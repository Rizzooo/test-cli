# Test::Cli

Welcome to NatParks! Here you'll be able to choose from the short list of available states, and dive into them to explore some of the most popular Landmarks/National Parks in that state!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'test-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install test-cli

## Usage

To get started enter './bin/nat-parks' in the terminal. You'll then be asked whether or not you're currently in any of the states available. If so, you'll be prompted to select the state you'd like to explore; else, you'll receive an apology message, and the app will close.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
